Introduction

This project is a simple menu-driven application developed in the C programming language. It is designed to strengthen core programming fundamentals by combining multiple logical operations into a single, interactive console-based program.

Why I Made This Project

I created this project to:

Practice writing structured and modular C programs

Understand how to use functions effectively

Learn how to design a menu-driven interface for better user interaction

Apply basic number logic concepts in a practical way

This project serves as a foundational exercise to improve problem-solving skills and confidence in C programming.

Aim of the Project

The main aim of this project is to:

Demonstrate the use of functions, loops, and conditional statements

Implement a menu-based system that allows users to select different operations

Perform basic numerical operations such as:

Printing numbers

Identifying even and odd numbers

Checking Armstrong numbers

The project focuses on clarity, simplicity, and logical correctness.

What I Learned

After completing this project, I gained a better understanding of:

Designing menu-driven programs

Using functions to improve code reusability and readability

Implementing for loops and while loops effectively

Applying conditional logic using if and switch statements

Taking user input and displaying formatted output

Breaking a problem into smaller, manageable components

Overall, this project helped strengthen my fundamentals in C and improved my logical thinking and coding discipline.
